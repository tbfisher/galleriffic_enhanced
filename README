An enhanced version of Trent Foley's jQuery Galleriffic plugin

I needed finer control over the output of this excellent gallery plugin, so I've made the following enhancements:

* Play-Pause, Previous, Next links are all in distinct div's for easier styling.
* Play, Pause, Previous, Next, Pagination links have HTML option to use non-text links.
